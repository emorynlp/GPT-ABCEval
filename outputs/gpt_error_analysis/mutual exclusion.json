    "gpt_reasoning": "Speaker 2 states that they are from the state of New York and were born and raised there, but their family moved to Florida when they were a baby. This statement does not contradict anything that Speaker 2 has previously said, nor does it contradict any world knowledge that has been shared. Therefore, it is not a self-contradiction."
