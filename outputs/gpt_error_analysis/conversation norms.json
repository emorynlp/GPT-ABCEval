      "2. Speaker 2: hi! I am happy to be talking to you. You know, I can't put my finger on why, but you kind of seem like you have a sister. Do you have any siblings?",
      "3. Speaker 1: I do! I actually have a younger brother",
      "4. Speaker 2: You have a brother? Cool! Do you guys get along?",
      "5. Speaker 1: We used to fight a lot when we were kids, but we get along now.",
      "6. Speaker 2: That's awesome. Personally, I always wanted an older sister so I could have someone to look up to. Are you older than your brother?",
      "7. Speaker 1: Yes. I'm the older sibling.",
      "8. Speaker 2: You know you seem really nice, and smart. I bet your brother looks up to you, even if you don't realize it.",
      "9. Speaker 1: That's kind of you to say! Hopefully I can be someone he looks up to.",
      "10. Speaker 2: For sure. So tell me, what is the most fun you've ever had with your brother?",
      "11. Speaker 1: It was probably when we secretly ate snacks behind my parents' backs",
      "12. Speaker 2: Right. That's a good one. Well I think it's great you get along with your brother. Anyway, what's a hobby you have that you really enjoy?",
      "13. Speaker 1: I really like watching Japanese anime",
      "14. Speaker 2: Okay, I see. Thanks for sharing that with me. What do you like so much about this hobby?",
      "15. Speaker 1: There's something to watch for everyone!",
      "16. Speaker 2: That makes sense. For me personally, I've been taking the time to read a little bit every day. It was slow going at first, but now I really enjoy it.",
      "17. Speaker 1: What books do you like to read?",
      "18. Speaker 2: I've only been reading the hobbit for a little bit now. I really like bilbo. I feel like I can relate a lot to someone who gets swept up in an adventure that's exhilarating, but where they are forced to learn to overcome tough new challenges.",
      "19. Speaker 1: Do you plan on reading the Lord of the Rings after the Hobbit?",
      "20. Speaker 2: I'm not sure. Do you have a favorite book?",
      "21. Speaker 1: I really like the Percy Jackson series",
      "22. Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Cool! What do you like about it?",
      "23. Speaker 1: I love how it goes into detail about Greek mythology. That was always an interesting topic to me.",
      "24. Speaker 2: Well I'll have to check it out. Maybe that will be the second book I read once I'm done with the hobbit!",
      "25. Speaker 1: I definitely recommend it!",
      "26. Speaker 2: Yeah. I hope you don't mind me asking, but are you dating anyone right now?"
